🚨 Help Wanted: CSRNet Headcount Web App (Uber Alpha 🚧)

Hey folks!

I’m currently working on a Dockerized headcount web app powered by CSRNet (the crowd counting deep learning model). The idea is to upload an image, run it through CSRNet, store the results in a DB, and then export everything into a preformatted Excel template.

The project is currently in Uber Alpha — meaning it’s about 80% vibe-coded and 20% duct tape. 😅 I’m actively cleaning up bugs, tightening up the logic, and improving structure.

🔍 What I’m Looking For
Feedback on architecture (FastAPI + Docker + PyTorch)

Help debugging any known issues or inefficiencies

Suggestions for cleaning up the flow or improving the UI/API

Ideas for features you'd like to see added

Any contributions at all, honestly. PRs, issues, vibes... it's all welcome

💡 Quick Overview
Upload an image → CSRNet estimates headcount

Store results (filename, timestamp, people count)

Export all that into a preformatted Excel .xlsx file

Access everything through Swagger UI (/docs)

Fully Dockerized

🧪 Try It Out
Clone the repo, download the pretrained weights from the CSRNet repo, and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t headcount-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v %cd%:/app headcount-app  # Use $(pwd) on Mac/Linux
Then go to:
http://localhost:8000/docs

🧠 Tech Stack
FastAPI backend

CSRNet model (PyTorch)

SQLite for now (pluggable DB later?)

openpyxl for Excel export

If you’re into computer vision, web dev, or just like the idea of having machines count heads so you don’t have to — I’d love your feedback or help.

Repo coming soon. If you’re interested, drop a comment or DM!

Stay crunchy,
Jon

Let me know if you want me to adjust it for a specific audience (GitHub, Reddit, Discord, etc.) or rewrite it for more professionalism or more memes.







You said:
whats up with "stay cruchy" lol


ChatGPT said:
LOL okay yeah — “Stay crunchy” is one of those quirky internet sign-offs like:

“Stay frosty” (military slang that got turned into gamer lingo)

“Stay weird” (Austin, TX and hipster culture)

“Stay crunchy” …which is mostly used by people who want to sound charmingly offbeat and vaguely breakfast-cereal adjacent. 🥣

It doesn't mean anything specific. It’s like saying “Keep being your awesome, oddball self.” Totally optional — I threw it in for flavor, but if it’s giving ✨Too Much Quirk✨ vibes, we can sub it out.

You want something cooler, church-techy, or just straightforward? Here are some swaps:

“Grace and bytes,”

“Catch y’all in the logs,”

“Keep the docker running,”

“May your containers never break and your counts be accurate,”

“Peace out and pixel on,”

or just go classic: “Thanks in advance!”

Wanna pick one or cook up a custom one together?

im a classy guy so lets go classic


ChatGPT said:
Ayyy, I respect that. Classy and clean it is. Here's the revised sign-off for your help post:

Thanks in advance for your time and any help you can offer.
– Jon

It’s timeless, respectful, and sounds like you actually know what you're doing (which, you do).

Let me know if you want me to plug that into the full version of the post or tweak anything else.







You said:
yep

Alright, here’s your classy, final version of the help post — polished up, ready to post wherever you need:
